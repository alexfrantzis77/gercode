    "## About this Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil classification is a fundamental process in geotechnical engineering, used to assess the properties and behavior of different soil types. Traditionally, this classification involves manual calculations and complex decision trees with numerous branches, sub-branches, and even more branches of classification based on ASTM/USCS standards. This process can be tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use Python to automate soil classification, transforming this intricate process into a structured, repeatable, and efficient algorithm. By breaking down the classification into logical steps, you will write intermediate functions that will ultimately be combined into a final function to determine soil classification. Programming is particularly well suited for this task, as it ensures consistency, eliminates manual errors, and enables rapid classification of multiple soil samples. Beyond improving efficiency, this approach strengthens your problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.\n",

    "## Question 1: Plasticity Index \n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Similar to mathematical functions, Python functions take in data, perform on them a sequence of statements, and then return output(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a mathematical function is: $f(x)=4x^2+2x-1$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a function that serves the same task looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "    return 4 * x ** 2 + 2 * x - 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to define a new function in Python is using the keyword `def` (short for define), as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(argument_1, argument_2, ...):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # function_body\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return output_parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax includes:\n",
    "1. Function header that begins with the keyword `def`, which is used to define a function\n",
    "2. `function_name`, which is the identifier chosen by the programmer (you)\n",
    "3. Input arguments `(argument_1, argument_2, ...)`, which are a comma-separated sequence of inputs that will be sent to the function \n",
    "4. `:` colon, which is used at the end of the function header, after the input arguments\n",
    "6. `function_body`, which is a sequence of code statements that the function will execute when called\n",
    "7. `return`, which will return (send back) the value(s) after the keyword to the calling statement\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> <b>NOTE!</b> The code that belongs to a function should be indented, as shown above. Indentation is important as it is the only way Python knows which code belongs to the function. It is standard in Python to use four spaces (equivalent to a tab) for indenting. If the code block is not indented correctly, this will raise an error.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin my defining our first simple function. Write a function named `plasticity_index()` that calculates and returns the plasticity index (PI) of a soil. This function has the following input arguments:\n",
    "* `LL`, which is the liquid limit of the soil in %\n",
    "* `PL`, which is the plastic limit of the soil in %\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that variable and function names in Python are case sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "After defining a function, and to use it, we need to **call** the function. To call a function, use its name followed by the values of the input arguments between parentheses: `function_name(argument_1, argument_2, ...)`. For the function that you will define, since the function is named `plasticity_index` and it takes two arguments, you can call it using the following syntax: `plasticity_index(30, 10)`. This will output the value 20, which is the plasticity index based on the given inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your `plasticity_index()` function to calculate the plasticity index of a soil with a liquid limit of 55% and a plastic limit of 25%. Assign the output to `q1`. Feel free to test it for any other inputs. Note that when calling the function, you should not include the units such as %. Only include the numeric value inside the parentheses."

    "## Question 2: Coarse- or Fine-Grained?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python can be written to do much more than evaluate a mathematical equation. Next, we will write another simple function that tells us whether a soil is coarse- or fine-grained. To do so, we will utilize something known as **conditional statements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, we make decisions based on certain conditions. For example, **if** it is raining, I will bring an umbrella before going outside. Similarly, we want computer programs to perform different actions based on specific conditions. This can be achieved using **conditional statements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we want to say something like *if this condition is true, do this, otherwise, do something else*, we can use the `if-else` syntax in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # do code block 1\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # do code block 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When Python encounters an if statement, it evaluates the specified condition.\n",
    "2. If the condition is `True`, Python executes code block 1.\n",
    "3. If the condition is `False`, Python skips code block 1 and proceeds to the else statement, executing code block 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The keyword `if` is followed by the condition, which is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`.\n",
    "* A colon `:` follows the condition, indicating the start of the code block.\n",
    "* The code block, which will only be executed if the condition is `True`, follows the colon. This block can contain one or more lines of code.\n",
    "* The code block *must be indented*. Indentation is crucial because it indicates which code belongs to the if statement.\n",
    "* The keyword `else` is used to define an alternate code block that will execute only if the condition in the `if` statement evaluates to `False`.\n",
    "* Like the `if` statement, the `else` statement ends with a colon `:` to indicate the start of the alternate code block.\n",
    "* The code block associated with `else` must also be indented, just like the `if` block. This indentation ensures that Python knows which code belongs to the `else` statement.\n",
    " \n",
    "Write a function named `coarse()` that checks whether a soil is coarse- or fine-grained. This function has the following input argument:\n",
    "* `P200`, which is the percentage of soil passing through Sieve #200 (i.e., percent finer) by weight (or mass)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should return the integer `1` if the soil is coarse-grained and the integer `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your `coarse()` function to check if a soil with `P200` equal to 40% is coarse- or fine-grained. Assign the output to `q2`. Feel free to test it for any other inputs."

    "## Question 5: Group Symbol for Fine-Grained Soils\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will only focus on inorganic soils.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function named `classify_fine()` that returns the group symbol classification for a fine-grained soil or the fine-grained portion of a soil. This function has the following input arguments:\n",
    "* `LL`, which is the liquid limit of the soil in %\n",
    "* `PL`, which is the plastic limit of the soil in %\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should return one of the following strings `'CL'`, `'ML'`, `'CH'`, `'MH'`, or `'CL-ML'`. Refer to the lecture material for the requirements of each group symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you must first determine whether the soil has low or high plasticity and whether the plasticity index plots above or below the \"A\"-line, use the `plasticity()` and `silt_or_clay()` functions you previously defined. You can call these functions within the implementation of the function below.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Hint**: It should be obvious that `'CL'`, `'ML'`, `'CH'`, and `'MH'` are a combination of the outputs from the `silt_or_clay()` and `plasticity()` functions. Meaning, if `silt_or_clay(55, 25)` returns `'C'` and `plasticity(55)` returns `'H'`, the group symbol is `'CH'` (combination of the two outputs). The only exception to this rule is the `'CL-ML'` group symbol. So here is how we suggest you approach this question:*\n",
    "1. Check the condition for `'CL-ML'`, and if satisfied (i.e., True), return `'CL-ML'` (refer to the lecture notes for the condition)\n",
    "2. Else, if the condition for `'CL-ML'` is not satisfied (i.e., False), return the combination of the outputs from the `silt_or_clay()` and `plasticity()` functions\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to combine the outputs of the `silt_or_clay()` and `plasticity()` functions is by placing a plus sign `+` between the function calls.  This will concatenate or \"glue\" their outputs together into a single string. Concatenation is a simple way to merge multiple strings into one. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `silt_or_clay(55, 25) + plasticity(55)` will evaluate to `'CH'` (i.e., `'C' + 'H'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your `classify_fine()` function using a soil with a liquid limit of 55% and a plastic limit of 25% and assign the output to `q8`. Feel free to test it for any other inputs from the ones shown below.\n",

    "You are able to use something called a **nested if statement**, which is an `if` statement inside another `if` statement. This allows for more complex conditions and actions. The syntax for nested `if` statements is:\n",
    "\n",

    "        # do code block 2b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the inner `if` statement is nested within the outer `if` statement, both condition_1 and condition_2 should be `True` for the innermost code block 1a to execute. This means that even if condition_2 is `True` but condition_1 is `False`, code block 1a will not be executed. In addition, the inner `if` statement must be indented further than the outer `if` statement to indicate that it is part of the outer `if` block.
